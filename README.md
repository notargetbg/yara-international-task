Thank you for the opportunity to work on this task.

This is a [Express/React](https://expressjs.com/en/) project bootstrapped with [`create-react-app`](https://create-react-app.dev/).

## How to start it

1. First, install the dependencies by running the following command in the `main` directory

```bash
npm install
```

2. Then install the dependencies by running the following command in the `/server` directory

```bash
npm install
```

3. Then run the development server in the `main` directory

```bash
npm run start
```

4. Finally run the nodemon server inside `/server` directory

```bash
npm run dev
```

5. You should be good to go! Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the result.

## Notes:

On initial load "music" events from "Munich" are loaded, so the page is not empty. Feel free to search for other event types, locations or by event name.

You can:
- add events to wishlist
- view your wishlist
- export wishlist to .pdf
- create new events
- view your created events
- more

## Extra functionality and further improvements I'd like to do

Extra things to do if I had even more time for development are:

- add some nice alerts/toast messages
- add a pagination or an infinite scroll
- add caching
- add unit tests
